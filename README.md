# RAC's Nest 🐭🐭🐭

A place where you can find RAC + MVVM examples

Why RAC's Nest?
--------------

Learning FRP takes time, learning how to apply the FRP paradigm to your app takes longer. Having a place where you can find common examples on how to use, is something that I missed, when I started working with ReactiveCocoa two years go. Let's change that.

Examples
--------

1. [Form 🐥](Documents/1_form.md) 
2. [Composition 🚗🚕🚙](Documents/2_composition.md)
2. [Search 🔍](Documents/3_search.md)

Contributing
-----------

I will gladly accept Pull Requests with new examples. If you would like to see an example, but you are unsure on how to do it, start by opening an issue and we will take it from there ✨️. As usual, documentation, or tests, typos fixes, are always welcome as well. ❤️
